# impress-polygon

This is a template for [impress.js](https://github.com/impress/impress.js/) that arranges slides on the edges of a regular polygon.

The main file is `haml/index.haml`. After inserting the number of edges, `N`, and the length of one edge in pixel, `L`, the code generates the coordinates (in the array `points`) and the rotation angles of the slides.

The compiled `html` file is also present, to understand how to compile the source see [HAML](http://haml.info/).
